### OER Researcher and Evaluator
With the support from [Open Education Group] through the OER Research Fellow program (https://openedgroup.org/fellowship){:Target"_blank"}, I conduct research on OER using theoretical frameworks including the [COUP Framework](https://openedgroup.org/coup){:Target"_blank"}. I am particularly interested in testing the effectiveness of the OER-enabled pedagogy program by assessing the improvement of students’ social-emotional learning and academic success outcome, and/or 3) assess instructors’ change in teaching attitude/style after using such an open pedagogy.  

### OER Creator

### OER User
I am an instructor actively adapting OERs in all my courses. With the funding from the LOUIS: LOUISiana Library Network through funding from Board of Regent, I have published my OER course adaptation tools and OER-enabled pedagogy documents for undergraduate-level [Introduction to Social Psychology](https://louis.oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/1216/overview){:Target"_blank"} and [Theories of Personality](https://louis.oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/1225/overview){:Target"_blank"}. The collections include a complete set of teaching courseware (syllabus, lecture slides, study guides, exam questions, in-class activities) that allows other instructors to easily transform their course into an OER course.
