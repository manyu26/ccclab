### OER Researcher and Evaluator
With the funding from [Open Education Group](https://openedgroup.org/fellowship){:Target"_blank"} through the OER Research Fellow program, I conduct research on OER using theoretical frameworks including the [COUP Framework](https://openedgroup.org/coup){:Target"_blank"}. I am particularly interested in testing the effectiveness of the OER-enabled pedagogy program by assessing the improvement of students’ social-emotional learning and academic success outcome, and/or assess instructors’ change in teaching attitude/style after using such an open pedagogy.  

### OER Creator
With the funding from LOUIS: LOUISiana Library Network [LOUIS’ Interactive OER for Dual Enrollment projectt through funding from the Department of Education](https://louislibraries.org/alearningla/programs/dual-enrollment){:Target"_blank"}, I am currently working with a team of psychology instructors to build a set of fully open, accessible OERs for students in dual enrollment introduction to psychology course. The final product will be in the format of Pressbook. 

### OER User
I am an instructor actively adapting OERs in all my courses. With the funding from the [LOUIS Affordable Learning LOUISiana Open Educational Resources Course Transformation Program through funding from the Louisiana Board of Regent](https://louislibraries.org/alearningla/reports-resources/course-transformation){:Target"_blank"}, I have published my OER course adaptation tools and OER-enabled pedagogy documents for undergraduate-level [Introduction to Social Psychology](https://louis.oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/1216/overview){:Target"_blank"} and [Theories of Personality](https://louis.oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/1225/overview){:Target"_blank"}. The collections include a complete set of teaching courseware (syllabus, lecture slides, study guides, exam questions, in-class activities) that allows other instructors to easily transform their course into an OER course. 

### OER Reviewer
With the stipend and training from [LOUIS OER Commons Faculty Cohort Program](https://louislibraries.org/alearningla/programs/cohort) and LOUIS Open Education Network, I have contributed to the OER community by reviewing the scope, accessibility, adaptability, content accuracy, cultural relevance, etc. using established rubric, such as the [BCCampus Open Text Rubric](https://open.bccampus.ca/use-open-textbooks/evaluate-open-textbooks/). I also served as a participant in user studies conducted by [ISKME](https://www.iskme.org/).
