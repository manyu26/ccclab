### OER Researcher and Evaluator
With the funding from [Open Education Group](https://openedgroup.org/fellowship){:Target"_blank"} through the OER Research Fellow program, I conduct research on OER using theoretical frameworks including the [COUP Framework](https://openedgroup.org/coup){:Target"_blank"}. I am particularly interested in testing the effectiveness of the OER-enabled pedagogy program by assessing the improvement of students’ social-emotional learning and academic success outcome, and assessing instructors’ change in teaching attitude/style after using such an open pedagogy.

### OER Creator
With the funding from LOUIS: LOUISiana Library Network [LOUIS’ Interactive OER for Dual Enrollment projectt through funding from the Department of Education](https://louislibraries.org/alearningla/programs/dual-enrollment){:Target"_blank"}, I am currently working with a team of psychology instructors to build a set of fully open, accessible OERs for students in dual enrollment introduction to psychology course. The final product will be in the format of Pressbook. 

With the funding from the APA Div. 2 Society for the Teaching of Psychology (STP) [Instructional Resrouce Award](https://teachpsych.org/page-1610199){:Target"_blank"} and the American Psychological Association (APA) [CABE Teaching Resource award](https://www.apa.org/about/awards/ptcc-teaching-resources?tab=4){:Target"_blank"}, I have developed a R-learning OER, titled [R Programming Guide for Psychology Teachers and Students](https://louis.oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/1310/overview){:Target"_blank"} and an assessment tool for teaching R in undergraduate classrooms, published in the [APA project assessment](http://pass.apa.org/login/?_redirected=yes){:Target"_blank"}. 

I am also an author for the Personality Chapter of [Promoting Psychological Science](http://teachpsych.org/ebooks/promotingpsychscience){:Target"_blank"} in the APA STP open e-book series.

### OER User
I am an instructor actively adapting OERs in all my courses. With the funding from the [LOUIS Affordable Learning LOUISiana Open Educational Resources Course Transformation Program through funding from the Louisiana Board of Regent](https://louislibraries.org/alearningla/reports-resources/course-transformation){:Target"_blank"}, I have published my OER course adaptation tools and OER-enabled pedagogy documents for undergraduate-level [Introduction to Social Psychology](https://louis.oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/1216/overview){:Target"_blank"} and [Theories of Personality](https://louis.oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/1225/overview){:Target"_blank"}. The collections include a complete set of teaching courseware (syllabus, lecture slides, study guides, exam questions, in-class activities) that allows other instructors to easily transform their course into an OER course. 

### OER Reviewer
With the stipend and training from [LOUIS OER Commons Faculty Cohort Program](https://louislibraries.org/alearningla/programs/cohort) and LOUIS Open Education Network, I have contributed to the OER community by reviewing the scope, accessibility, adaptability, content accuracy, cultural relevance, etc. using established rubric, such as the [BCCampus Open Text Rubric](https://open.bccampus.ca/use-open-textbooks/evaluate-open-textbooks/). I also served as a participant in user studies conducted by [ISKME](https://www.iskme.org/).
