### RELACSS Social Science Data Analytics Workshop Series for Beginners 

Calling all social science students in Louisiana! Learn R programming and data analysis easily with fellow students. Organized by Dr. Manyu Li at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, the workshop and all materials are free to all participants. 

**Overview of the Program**

Data analysis is essential to the understanding of important social science phenomena. The rising availability of big data also shifts how social scientists conduct research. Knowing more about data analysis helps students prepare for advanced studies and graduate school. Join the RELACSS workshop series to learn about basic data analytics in social science using R programming, a computer programming language commonly used by social scientists. 

After participating in the workshop, students will be able to
* identify basic data analytic steps;
* explore a real-world, open cross-cultural dataset and formulate testable research questions;
* interpret data analysis results;
* write simple R codes to execute the data tasks.

**Eligibility**

All undergraduate and graduate social science students in Louisiana, regardless of years in college and past experiences are invited to participate. No prior experiences are required. Examples of Social Science majors are anthropology, communications, communicative disorders, criminal justice, human development and family science, political science, psychology, and sociology. Students who are interested in social science research and data analytics but are not social science majors may also be considered. 

Faculty members who want to sit in the class may also complete the form or email manyu.li@louisiana.edu directly to discuss. 

The free workshop series is a 6-week program taught by Dr. Manyu Li, Assistant Professor of Psychology at UL Lafayette. Each session is 1 hour on Zoom. Participants will include students from all over Louisiana universities and colleges. The form will ask you to indicate your availability. 

RELACSS stands for Rapport-building, Equitable, Learner-centered, Authentic Computational Social Science beginner program. The goal of the program is to support students to easily step into the world of Computational Social Science.
