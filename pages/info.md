### Data Science Application in Social and community psychology 

In the Data-science Application in SOcial and community psychology (DAISO) lab, we conduct quantitative studies or mixed-method studies to understand issues such as sense of belonging, community engagement, place attachment, and migration, and immigration. Students in the lab will learn statistics and research methods to conduct research relating to these topics. Students will also have the opportunities to present at national conferences and apply for scholarships.  Since 2017, five of our lab student members have been funded as the McNair Scholar!

### What does DAISO mean?

The Data-science-Application In SOcial and community psychology (DAISO) LAB focuses on improving data science in social/community psychology. In Cantonese, DAISO 大數（據）means Big Number or Big Data, highlighting the lab’s focus on analyzing big data and advancing data science in psychology.The name also recognizes my Hong Kong heritage and to pay tribute to the place that taught me the wonderful world of Mathematics and statistics!
