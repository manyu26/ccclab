...and learn at the same time.

*Feeling Responsive* is my first theme which I let into the world. It's built on work and knowledge of others. While I am still designing it, you read about whats behind this theme in the – *hopefully* – near future.


## Features

<p><strong>What does DAISO mean?</strong></p>

<li>In Cantonese, DAISO&nbsp;<em>大數（據</em>）means Big Number or Big Data, highlighting the lab’s focus on analyzing big data and improving data science in psychology.&nbsp; This is also to recognize my Hong Kong heritage and to pay tribute to the place that taught me the wonderful world of Mathematics and statistics!</li>



## I got inspired by...

[Michael Rose][1] and his fabulous [themes for jekyll][2]. Authors of [A List Apart][4] and [Smashing Magazine][5] since 2002. [GitHub][6] and how they built such a habitat for cooperation worldwide. [Automattic][3] and how they built a fantastic community around WordPress. And many, many more...

Please make *Feeling Responsive* yours and if you like it, please link back to my homebase <a href="http://phlow.de/">Phlow</a>. That would be awesome.

#### Since then, fork it!

Yours sincerelly, [Moritz »mo.« Sauer][7]
