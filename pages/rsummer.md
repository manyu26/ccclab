* [Learning to Work With R](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/learning-to-work-with-r){:target="_blank"} (Weston and Yee, 2017)
* [R Tutorials](https://debyeeneuro.com/r-tutorials/){:target="_blank"} slides and resources by Weston and Yee (2016, 2017)
* [R Programming for Psychology Teachers and Students](https://louis.oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/1310/overview){:target="_blank"} e-text (Li, 2021)
* [Using R for Psychological Research](http://personality-project.org/r/r.guide.html){:target="_blank"} by The Personality Project
* and many many more... 

## Week 1 - Basic R knowledge 
* [Week 1 Workshop notes and codes](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LYQIwPKewYRPKejuf3h7MryjLbQi7GKX?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} (powered by [Google Research Colaborartory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb?utm_source=scs-index"){:target="_blank"} no installation is required to run codes) 

### Learning Objectives  
* define/describe basic concepts/components in R, including objects, class, vectors, factors, indexing, data frames, list, and matrices. 
* identify basic operators and functions.
* install and request packages. 
* subset data frames, select columns/rows from data frames and remove unwanted samples from data.
* create new variables and recode variables.

### Homework:
* Install and start RStudio, set a working directory, and import a *.csv* file as a data frame. You may use your own data file or the sample data file I share in our group email. Ask peer mentor if you have any questions. If they are not resolved, we will discuss the problems at the beginning of Week 2. Consult [Chapter 1 and 2 of Li (2021) R Programming for Psychology Teachers and Students](https://louis.oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/1310/overview){target="_blank"}
