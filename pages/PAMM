## What is Psychology Academic Mentoring Matters (PAMM)

The Psychology Chapter of the Academic Mentoring Matters (PAMM) is a peer-mentoring program launched in 2021. The primary goal is to provide free tutoring for students one-on-one on various psychology courses. Mentors are students whom have already taken the classes in psychology and earned A's in the classes. Mentors meet mentees regularly at the psychology department student lounge (second floor of Girard Hall across from room 203). 

The schedule can be found below:
