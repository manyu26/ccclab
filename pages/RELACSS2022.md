## Call for Applications

**Overview of the Program.** Calling all social science students! Data analysis is essential to the understanding of important social science phenomena. The rising availability of big data also shifts how social scientists conduct research. Knowing more about data analysis helps students prepare for advanced studies and graduate school. Join the RELACSS workshop series to learn about basic data analytics in social science using R programming, a computer programming language commonly used by social scientists. 

After participating in the workshop, students will be able to
* identify basic data analytic steps;
* explore a real-world, open cross-cultural dataset and formulate testable research questions;* interpret data analysis results;
* write simple R codes to execute the data tasks.

**Eligibility**: All social science students at UL Lafayette, regardless of years in college and past experiences are invited to participate. **No prior experiences are required.** Social Science majors at UL Lafayette include anthropology, communications, communicative disorders, criminal justice, human development and family science (previously CAFS), political science, psychology, and sociology. Students who are interested in social science research and data analytics but are not social science majors may also be considered.  

The free workshop series is a 6-week program taught by Dr. Manyu Li, Assistant Professor of Psychology. Each session is 1 hour. The meeting time will be determined by the applicants' availability. The meeting location is Girard Hall (room TBD).  

RELACSS stands for Rapport-building, Equitable, Learner-centered, Authentic Computational Social Science beginner program. The goal of the program is to support students to easily step into the world of Computational Social Science.
