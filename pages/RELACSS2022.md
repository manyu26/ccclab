This is a collection of materials/resources used in the RELACSS beginner workshop offered by Dr. Manyu Li for UL Lafayette social science students in 2022. Materials are designed with the interactive shiny app with the learnr package. 

All resources used in the workshop are shared/linked on this page. All weekly notes and codes are licensed under [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) unless otherwise stated.

## Getting Started/Comprehensive Resources:
* [Learning to Work With R](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/learning-to-work-with-r){:target="_blank"} (Weston and Yee, 2017)
* [R Tutorials](https://debyeeneuro.com/r-tutorials/){:target="_blank"} slides and resources by Weston and Yee (2016, 2017)
* [R Programming for Psychology Teachers and Students](https://louis.oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/1310/overview){:target="_blank"} e-text (Li, 2021)
* [Using R for Psychological Research](http://personality-project.org/r/r.guide.html){:target="_blank"} by The Personality Project
* and many many more... 

## Week 1 - Basic R knowledge 
* [Week 1 Workshop notes and codes](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LYQIwPKewYRPKejuf3h7MryjLbQi7GKX?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} (powered by [Google Research Colaborartory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb?utm_source=scs-index"){:target="_blank"} no installation is required to run codes) 

### Learning Objectives  
* define/describe basic concepts/components in R, including objects, class, vectors, factors, indexing, data frames, list, and matrices. 
* identify basic operators and functions.
* install and request packages. 
* subset data frames, select columns/rows from data frames and remove unwanted samples from data.
* create new variables and recode variables.

### Homework:
* Install and start RStudio, set a working directory, and import a *.csv* file as a data frame. You may use your own data file or the sample data file I share in our group email. Ask peer mentor if you have any questions. If they are not resolved, we will discuss the problems at the beginning of Week 2. Consult [Chapter 1 and 2 of Li (2021) R Programming for Psychology Teachers and Students](https://louis.oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/1310/overview){:target="_blank"}
