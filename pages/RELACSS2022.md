RELACSS is a recurring data analysis workshop offered by Dr. Manyu Li for Louisiana college students (see [the Latest Call for Applications](https://manyu26.github.io/daisolab/teaching/RELACSS1callapp)). Materials are designed with the interactive shiny app with the learnr package. All resources used in the workshop are shared/linked on this page. **No software download is needed**. The link under each module will bring you to the Shiny learnr lesson on shinyapps website.

## Module 1 (Week 1) - *Checking it out*
<span style="background-color: #E3E3E3;font-size:1.2em"> Taking a bird-eye view of the social science research inquiry process </span>

By the end of the module, learners will be able to
* describe what data analysis is;
* state one example of how social scientist solves research question through data analysis;
* identify the role of data analysis in social science

## Module 2 (Week 2 - 3) - *Trying it out* 
<span style="background-color: #E3E3E3;font-size:1.2em" > Analyzing data with precooked R codes</span>

By the end of the module, learners will be able to
* describe fundamental steps of research (inquiry) process and data analysis in social science;
* identify data structure through the use of a real-world cross-cultural open dataset;
* interpret the meaning of existing research questions 
* run existing R codes to solve research questions;
* interpret the results of the analysis performed

## Module 3 (Week 4) - *Changing the game*
<span style="background-color: #E3E3E3;font-size:1.2em"> Modifying research questions and editing R codes </span>

By the end of the module, learners will be able to
* Modify research questions based on learners' own interests in the real-world cross-cultural open data;
* Compare basic R codes and distinguish codes based on analytic purposes;
* Repeat the data analysis process from Module 2 with modified research questions;
* Interpret the results of the analysis performed

## Module 4 (Week 5 - 6) - *Taking charge*
<span style="background-color: #E3E3E3;font-size:1.2em"> Creating data analysis plan and codes from scratch </span>

By the end of the module, learners will be able to
* design new research questions with an expanded list of variables from the real-world cross-cultural open data;
* formulate a data analysis plan to answer the research questions developed;
* write and run R codes to administer the data analysis plan; 
* present the findings and interpretation of the results
