## Research Interests

My research focuses on pursuing more efficient synthetic methods and achieving higher level perfection in the design of polymer architectures via controlled/living polymerization methods; and the study of applications of polymeric materials with well-defined structures in organic electronics, batteries, nanodiagnostics, and therapeutics, stimuli-responsive materials, etc.
