In the Data-science Application in SOcial and community psychology (DAISO) lab, we conduct quantitative or mixed-method studies to understand issues such as sense of belonging, community engagement, place attachment, and migration and immigration. Students in the lab will learn research and data analytic methods to conduct research relating to these topics. Students will also be able to present at national conferences and apply for scholarships.  Since 2017, six lab student members have been funded as McNair Scholars!

DAISO is developed by Dr. Manyu Li @ University of Louisiana at Lafayette.
