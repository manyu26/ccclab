<p><em>Note to researchers: The Psychological place attachment (PPAS) has both an original long form (30-item) and a short form (13 items). </em><em>To use the scale, replace the blank with the name of the place you intend to study. </em><em>R</em><em> indicates reverse codied items. In the original study (see citations below), the original (long form) PPAS was tested using both 18-22 year old  students at the University of Pittsburgh (in  PA, USA) and community sample of 19-61 year old adults who had lived in Pittsburgh, PA, USA. <strong>Amharic, Slovene and Turkish versions</strong> also exist and can be sent upon request. The PPAS-Short Form scale was tested using 18-22 year old students at the University of Pittsburgh.</em></p>
<p><em>Please feel free to use the scale. We are also open to discussion and collaboration. <strong>We do ask that you send us your project publications so that we can keep track of research being done using the PPAS. If you translate the scale into another language or make any changes to the scale, we would appreciate a copy of the translation. </strong>Thank you very much for your interest in the PPAS.</em></p>
